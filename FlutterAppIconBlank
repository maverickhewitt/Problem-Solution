Icon Apps goes blank even when you use the launcher.
The solution is downgrade the version of flutter_launcher_icons because maybe their new update bug

next solution is adding this code
adaptive_icon_background: "#ffffff" # You can use a color or image for the background
adaptive_icon_foreground: "assets/icon.png" # For adaptive icons on Android
